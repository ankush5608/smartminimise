                <p>Using the hydrogen powered or electric powered vehicles instead of the vehicles which are been operated by fossil fuels like petroleum and diesel which would not only full-fill the energy demand but also the byproducts emitted by them are harmless. Also these sources are abundant in nature and hence there is no worry about their extinction.</p>

                <p>When the weather conditions are at peak the renewable sources like solar and wind produces great amount of energy but this gets wasted because of the storing issue. Using the grid technology and following the flowchart technique would certainly solve this issue.</p>

            <p>The hydrgen fuel and electric vehicles are the best replacement for fossil fueled vehicles, but in order to achieve this it will take atleast 30 years. Hence until that a measure must be made to save the fuel and make convenient use of that. Making the vehicle system intelligent and using the AI networks will avoid the wastage of fuel. During the traffic conditions the vehicles will remain idle and unnecessary fuel usage take place using AI to auto control this will avoid the fuel wastage.</p>
