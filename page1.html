            <h2>Smart Minimisation and Replacement of Fuel Energy</h2>
            <p> We know that the world is geting revolutionized and as the tech gets advanced
                need of energy will also hipe up. Now in the present scenario we use our fossil fuels only as
                our major source of energy these are not only exhaustible but also injurious to our
                environment./p>

    <p> The availability of energy has transformed the course of humanity over the last few centuries. Not only have new sources of energy been unlocked  first fossil fuels, followed by a diversification to nuclear, hydropower and now other renewable technologies but also in the quantity we can produce and consume.

        This article focuses on the quantity of energy we consume looking at total energy and electricity consumption; how countries compare when we look at this per person; and how energy consumption is changing over time.
        
        In our pages on the Energy Mix and Electricity Mix we look in more detail at what sources provide this energy.
        
        In the energy domain, there are many different units thrown around joules, exajoules, million tonnes of oil equivalents, barrel equivalents, British thermal units, terawatt-hours, to name a few. This can be confusing, and make comparisons difficult. So at Our World in Data we try to maintain consistency by converting all energy data to watt-hours. We do this to compare energy data across different metrics and sources.</p>

   <p>Thus its found that our majority of energy is produced by fossil fuels like coal, petroleum, diesel etc. As these are non-renewable they will be exhausted one day or the other and also are harming our environment. Hence we have to either try to minimise its usage or find better alternatives like renewable sources of the kind solar, wind, tidal etc and help in saving our environment along with the satisfactory energy production.</p>
